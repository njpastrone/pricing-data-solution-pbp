## ðŸš¨ NON-NEGOTIABLE PROJECT RULES - READ FIRST ðŸš¨

**These rules MUST be followed for ALL work on this project:**

1. **Always use Python for all development**
2. **Leverage Streamlit for the front-end**
3. **Write beginner-friendly code** - code must be readable and understandable by a beginner Python programmer
4. **Always take the simplest route to solving problems**
5. **The entire app should be "vibe-coder friendly"** - prioritize clarity over cleverness
6. **Make autonomous decisions** - avoid asking for user permissions unless making dangerous changes
7. **Minimize the size of the code base** - keep the project simple with fewer files when possible
8. **Avoid duplicating code**
9. **Refer to markdown files for context consistently**
10. **Do not be afraid to ask the user for questions or clarifications**

## Important References

**ALWAYS refer to [docs/PLANNING.md](docs/PLANNING.md) for project requirements, architecture decisions, and implementation plans before starting any work.**

**ALWAYS refer to [docs/DATA_STRUCTURE.md](docs/DATA_STRUCTURE.md) for the exact structure of the jaggery_demo data to avoid coding mistakes.**

**ALWAYS refer to [docs/METHODOLOGY_LOGIC.md](docs/METHODOLOGY_LOGIC.md) for pricing calculations, business rules, and partner-specific methodologies.**

## Project Overview

This is the pricing-data-solution-pbp project - a Python/Streamlit application focused on simplicity and beginner-friendly code.

## Development Guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the repository
- Ensure all changes are well-tested before committing
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up Google Sheets credentials:**
   - Credentials are stored in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
   - Never commit this file to git (protected by .gitignore)

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Test connection:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run scripts/test_connection.py
   ```

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python-based web app)
- **Data Source:** Google Sheets (master_pricing_demo)
- **Authentication:** Google Cloud service account
- **Data Flow:**
  1. App connects to Google Sheets via `gspread`
  2. Loads pricing data into pandas DataFrame
  3. User selects products and enters custom options
  4. App calculates quotes using formula: `(base_price * markup%) + shipping + tariff`
  5. Displays proposal and invoice as copyable tables

## Common Tasks

- **Refresh pricing data:** Click menu â†’ "Rerun" in the Streamlit app
- **Update credentials:** Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- **Test API connection:** Run `streamlit run scripts/test_connection.py`
- **Investigate data structure:** `streamlit run scripts/investigate_jaggery_demo.py` or `python scripts/check_jaggery_demo.py`
- **Deploy to cloud:** Follow Streamlit Cloud deployment guide (add secrets in app settings)
