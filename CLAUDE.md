# CLAUDE.md

This file provides context about the project for Claude Code.

## Important

**ALWAYS refer to [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md) for project requirements, architecture decisions, and implementation plans before starting any work.**

- Always use Python for all development.  
- Leverage Streamlit for the front-end.  
- Write beginner-friendly code.  
- Always take the simplest route to solving problems.  
- Write code that can be read and understood by a beginner Python programmer — the entire app should be “vibe-coder friendly.”  
- Make autonomous decisions. Avoid asking for user permissions unless making dangerous changes.  
- When possible, minimize the size of the code base (number of files), keeping the project simple.  
- Avoid duplicating code.  
- Refer to markdown files for context consistently.  
- Do not be afraid to ask the user for questions or clarifications.
